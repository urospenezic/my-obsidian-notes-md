**NuGet Gallery -> easy way to add nuget packages. ADDS A NEW TAB NEXT TO TERMINAL TAB, DEBUG CONSOLE ETC CALLED NUGET

**C# Dev Kit -> Baked in almost solid VS experience

**CSharpier - Opinionated code formatter for C#

**Dev Containers + Container Tools -> docker

**Material Icon Theme -> for nice icons

**Prettier -> formatter for JS/TS/Angular

**SQL Server (includes SQL Database Project, SQL Bindings, mssql) 

**SQLite -> less headache on non windows env (if using EF, its not that needed since EF does the querying, but its nice). What it does is it adds a new tab in file explorer called SQLITE Explorer. From here we got the usual look at our DB, but the advantage over the Viewer is that we can right click and generate and execute queries.

**SQLite Viewer -> nice visualization tool for SQLite DBs

**Angular Language Service -> angular support

**Angular Snippets 

**ESLint -> default integrated JS linting in VS Code

**Log File Hihglighter -> formats the terminal/output colors
