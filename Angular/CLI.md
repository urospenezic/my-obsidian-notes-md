ng new "nameOfProject" -> scaffolds default project

ng serve -> runs the app

**ng g (short for generate) --help -> bread and butter of angular cli

--help can be used in lower contexts, such as "ng g c --help" because there are things like --skip-tests --skip-selector etc

--dry run -> show you what would be created in terminal without actually doing it
