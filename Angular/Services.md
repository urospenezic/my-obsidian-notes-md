Local services that can be injected into components. Usually do most of heavy lifting logic stuff

It's nothing super special, but it's very useful in a way its set up. Also look into course-projects repo for a lot of in depth stuff on services. I've started taking these notes after finishing 100+ hours of Angular courses..

TLDR: it's just a singleton class with a @Injectable adorner/decorator that lets it be auto injected anywhere we specify. it's perfect for data fetching, maintaining caches etc.
