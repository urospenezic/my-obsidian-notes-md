@Component in ts file has a lot of properties, selector gives a name to component that can be accessed in markup. So if selector name is random-name, we can render that component in markup via <random-name>. imports are used to import stuff like injectable, modules, lots of stuff. templateUrl is obvious. styleUrl same. There are lots more attributes here, most of them covered in comments throughout angular projects.
